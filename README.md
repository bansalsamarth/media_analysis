# Media Analysis

In this project, I analyse two primary spaces where digital media editors have power to control the flow of information: site’s homepage and their official social media account.

Homepage stories are indicative of a newspaper’s editorial preferences. Which topics are “played up” i.e. get more prominence? This approach allows us to go deeper than the standard media studies analysis which looks at the overall set of stories.

#### Research Questions 
* What’s the topical compositions of the information diets produced by major English newspapers of India via their homepages?
* Does the composition change on Facebook?

#### Data
The scrapers in this repository fetches stories on each website's homepage every 15 minutes. Not all stories on the homepage are collected. Stories which are “played up”, that is, displayed in prominent sections of the homepage are collected.

**System is collecting data for the following** 
* **India**: Indian Express, The Hindu, Hindustan Times
* **UK**: BBC, Guardian, Telegraph
* **US**: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post
* **Canda**: CBC, Globe and the Mail, National Post
